Inserting Data:
To insert data into a table in SQLite using Python, you can use the execute() method of the cursor object. For example, if you have a table called "users" with columns "id", "name", and "age", you could insert a new row like this:
sql
Copy code
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Insert a new row into the "users" table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 25)")

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
Updating Data:
To update existing data in a table, you can use the UPDATE command in a similar way. For example, to update the age of the user with ID 1 to 30, you could use the following code:
makefile
Copy code
# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Update the age of the user with ID 1 to 30
cursor.execute("UPDATE users SET age = 30 WHERE id = 1")

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
Deleting Data:
To delete data from a table, you can use the DELETE command. For example, to delete the user with ID 1, you could use the following code:
makefile
Copy code
# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Delete the user with ID 1
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1")

# Commit the transaction
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
Selecting Data:
To select data from a table, you can use the SELECT command and fetch the results using the fetchall() or fetchone() methods of the cursor object. For example, to select all the rows from the "users" table, you could use the following code:
sql
Copy code
# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Select all the rows from the "users" table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# Fetch
